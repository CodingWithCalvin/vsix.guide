Before you can create Visual Studio extensions, you need to install the required tools and workloads.

## Required Software

### Visual Studio 2022

You need Visual Studio 2022 (any edition) with the **Visual Studio extension development** workload installed.

To install or add the workload:

1. Open **Visual Studio Installer**
2. Click **Modify** on your VS 2022 installation
3. Go to the **Workloads** tab
4. Check **Visual Studio extension development**
5. Click **Modify** to install

<Callout type="note">
The extension development workload includes the Visual Studio SDK, project templates, and debugging tools.
</Callout>

### .NET Framework 4.8

Visual Studio extensions target .NET Framework 4.8. This is typically already installed with Visual Studio, but you can verify or install it from [Microsoft's download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48).

## Recommended Tools

### VSIX Viewer

The VSIX Viewer tool lets you inspect the contents of `.vsix` packages:

```powershell
# Install from Visual Studio Marketplace or via Extensions menu
```

### Extensibility Essentials

The [Extensibility Essentials](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.ExtensibilityEssentials2022) extension pack by Mads Kristensen includes helpful tools for extension development:

- Command Explorer - Browse available VS commands
- VSCT IntelliSense - Better editing for `.vsct` files
- KnownMonikers Explorer - Browse VS image monikers
- And more...

<Callout type="tip">
Install Extensibility Essentials 2022 from Extensions > Manage Extensions in Visual Studio.
</Callout>

## Project Templates

After installing the workload, you'll have access to VSIX project templates:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **VSIX Project** | Empty extension project |
| **VSIX Project w/ Command** | Extension with a menu command |
| **VSIX Project w/ Tool Window** | Extension with a dockable tool window |
| **Editor Classifier** | Syntax highlighting extension |
| **Editor Margin** | Custom editor margin |

## Verify Your Setup

To verify everything is installed correctly:

1. Open Visual Studio 2022
2. Go to **File > New > Project**
3. Search for "VSIX"
4. You should see the VSIX project templates

If you see the templates, you're ready to create your first extension!

## Next Steps

Continue to [Your First Extension](first-extension) to create a simple "Hello World" command.
