This section covers the fundamental concepts you need to understand when building Visual Studio extensions.

## What You'll Learn

- **Service Provider Pattern** - How to access VS services
- **AsyncPackage** - Modern package implementation
- **Commands** - Adding menu items and keyboard shortcuts
- **Tool Windows** - Creating dockable windows
- **Editors** - Extending the text editor
- **Options Pages** - Adding settings UI

## Prerequisites

Before diving into these topics, make sure you've completed the [Getting Started](/introduction) section and have a working extension project.

## Core Architecture

Visual Studio extensions are built on several key architectural patterns:

### COM and Managed Code

Visual Studio's core is COM-based, but the VS SDK provides managed wrappers. Understanding when you're crossing this boundary helps explain some API patterns.

### MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework)

Many editor features use MEF for discovery and composition. Components export interfaces that VS imports automatically.

### Services

VS provides functionality through services - singleton objects accessed via the service provider pattern. This decouples components and enables extensibility.

## Next Steps

Start with [Service Provider](/service-provider) to understand how to access Visual Studio's functionality from your extension.
